  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<p class="drop-cap">I create performance art for radio. Through live audio collages, I transgress boundaries and challenge conventional listening while creating an experience that remains compelling and inviting. Each program builds connections across disparate material highlighting threads of defiance, artistic strategies and recurring political themes.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">I fracture and recombine elements of underground culture from both the late 20th century and contemporary sources, refusing to separate "historical" from "current". In intermingling materials from different decades, I illuminate how contemporary issues echo historical struggles—revealing the persistent currents of rebellion flowing through subcultures. I intertwine spoken word, sound poetry, experimental music, DIY recordings, avant-garde compositions, and captured voices. With these elements I form narratives that provoke thought and emotional response.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">Voice and language are central to my work—whether through sound poetry, recorded dialogue, speech fragments, or other oral expressions. These human utterances create an emotional anchor within the unconventional structure, making potentially alienating material both accessible and engaging.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">Humor is an essential tool in my practice, offering unexpected entry points into difficult subject matter. I incorporate comedic elements into my shows to create moments of release and transformation, allowing listeners to process tragedy, anger and political urgency through a softening lens. The juxtaposition of the serious with the absurd reflects the complex reality of resistance movements throughout history.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">My schizotypal perception—a neurological framework that reveals unexpected patterns across disparate sources—includes a heightened sensitivity to authenticity. I organize sounds not by era or genre, but by their resonance with ongoing social struggles, artistic innovations and raw urgency. This sensitivity draws me to work rooted in genuine expression rather than that which seeks validation.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">A queer feminist methodology guides my selection process, questioning whose voices have been preserved. I amplify perspectives that oppose dominant cultural narratives, even within experimental music history. My shows simultaneously preserve marginalized artistic recordings while recontextualizing these materials to demonstrate their vital relevance to contemporary struggles.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">I dedicate extensive research to uncovering exceptional works that have fallen between the cracks—pieces of undeniable artistic merit yet minimal recognition. My rigorous excavation process creates moments of genuine surprise that disrupt patterns of predictable, passive consumption. I spotlight works too uncompromising for mainstream channels yet overlooked even within underground circles.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">Radio creates an intimate connection with listeners wherever they are, allowing complex artistic content to infiltrate everyday life in ways visual art cannot. Freeform radio inherently opposes commercial broadcasting's limitations. My work extends this protest by featuring nonconforming artists who confront systems of power. By operating in web-based radio, free from FCC constraints, my programs embrace provocative content and uncensored voices that FM would silence. The live nature of my broadcasts adds an element of risk and immediacy that recorded media cannot replicate.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">Through my radio practice, I expand what radio art can be—not just a platform for curated sounds, but a performative space where diverse vocal expressions and sound art become tools for reimagining our relationship to art, politics, and collective memory.</p>
