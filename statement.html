  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<section>
  <p>I create performance art for radio. My live audio collages transgress boundaries while remaining accessible—a tension that fuels my work. Each program builds connections across subcultures, highlighting threads of rebellion, avant-garde approaches and recurring social themes.</p>

  <p>I recombine fragments of underground culture—spoken word, experimental music, sound poetry, DIY recordings and captured voices—from the late 20th century to the present. By centering voice and language, I create narratives that illuminate how contemporary issues echo historical struggles. I use comedic elements to create moments of release, allowing listeners to process tragedy, anger and political urgency through an absurdist lens. With my queer feminist spirit, I amplify perspectives that oppose dominant narratives and recontextualize them. Together these elements generate moments of surprise that disrupt patterns of predictable passive consumption.</p>

  <p>Radio offers an intimate connection with listeners, enabling artistic content to infiltrate everyday life. Freeform radio actively resists commercial broadcasting’s constraints, creating space for authentic expression. My work extends this opposition by featuring nonconforming artists who confront systems of power. The live format adds risk and immediacy that recorded media cannot replicate.</p>

  <p>Through my weekly practice and ongoing research, I expand what radio art can be—not just a platform for curated sound but a performative space where uncompromising audio reimagines our relationship to art, collective memory and protest.</p>
