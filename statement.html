  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<p>I create performance art for radio. Through live audio collages, I transgress boundaries while remaining engaging. Each program builds connections across disparate subcultures highlighting threads of defiance, artistic techniques and recurring political themes.</p>

<p>I recombine fragments of underground culture—spoken word, sound poetry, experimental music, DIY recordings, avant-garde compositions, speech fragments and captured voices—from late 20th century to the present. By centering voice and language, I form provocative narratives that illuminate how contemporary issues echo historical challenges.</p>

<p>I use comedic elements to create moments of release, enabling listeners to process tragedy, anger and political urgency through a softening lens. This collision of the serious and the absurd reflects the complex reality of human experience.</p>

<p>My schizotypal perception—marked by heightened pattern recognition and an acute sensitivity to authenticity—shapes how I organize sounds, by their resonance with social struggles, artistic innovations and raw urgency. I’m drawn to work rooted in uncompromising expression rather than that which seeks validation.</p>

<p>A queer feminist approach drives my selection process. I research extensively to uncover exceptional works that have fallen between the cracks, always ensuring they resonate with me on a personal level. By amplifying perspectives that oppose dominant cultural narratives and recontextualizing them, I create moments of surprise that disrupt patterns of predictable, passive consumption.</p>

<p>Radio offers an intimate connection with listeners, allowing complex artistic content to infiltrate everyday life. Freeform radio inherently opposes the limitations of commercial broadcasting. My work extends this opposition by featuring nonconforming artists who confront systems of power. Operating in web-based radio, free from FCC constraints my programs embrace provocative content that FM would silence. The live format adds risk and immediacy that recorded media cannot replicate.</p>

<p>Through my weekly practice I expand what radio art can be—not just a platform for curated sound but a performative space where diverse vocal expressions and audio experimentation reimagine our relationship to art, collective memory and protest.</p>
