  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<section>
<p>I create performance art for radio. My live audio collages transgress boundaries without sacrificing accessibility—a tension that fuels my work. Each program builds connections across subcultures, highlighting threads of subversion in sound and themes. </p>

<p>I recombine fragments of underground culture—spoken word, experimental music, sound poetry, DIY recordings, and captured voices—from around the world, spanning the late 20th century to the present. By centering voice and language, I create narratives that illuminate how contemporary issues echo historical struggles. I use comedic elements to create moments of release, allowing listeners to process tragedy, anger and political urgency through an absurdist lens. With my queer feminist spirit, I seek out, recontextualize, and amplify perspectives that challenge the established order. These elements work together to generate moments of surprise that disrupt patterns of predictable, passive listening.</p>

<p>Radio offers an intimate connection with listeners, enabling artistic content to infiltrate everyday life. Freeform radio exists beyond commercial constraints, creating a platform for authentic expression. My work extends this opposition by featuring nonconforming artists who confront systems of power. The live format adds risk and immediacy that recorded media cannot replicate.</p>

<p>Through my weekly practice and relentless research, I transform radio into something more uncompromising, and immediate—a performative space where unheard voices reimagine our relationship to audio, protest, collective memory.</p>
