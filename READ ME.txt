Hi,

I am Félix Farjas, a french student in graphism (https://www.instagram.com/felixfarjas/).

Few month ago, i made a penis typography for fun (https://www.dafont.com/fr/penis-typography.font),
but this kind of typography had already been done all over the internet.

However, after doing some research, I realized that there was no vulva typography.
It was then a mission for me.

Indeed, drawing a penis is simple, everyone has already done it,
but finding a simple and universal way to represent a vulva was not.

Each letter has been redesigned 3 or 4 times to finally obtain an aesthetic, playful and committed result.
Each letter consists of a vulva with its hairs.


This typography proposal is intended to give women a tool to appropriate their own bodies.

Thanks !
